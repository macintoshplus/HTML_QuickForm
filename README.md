HTML_QuickForm
==============

The HTML_QuickForm package provides methods to dynamically create, validate and render HTML forms.

This package is based in the [original PEAR library](http://pear.php.net/package/HTML_QuickForm), but the code has been 
updated to be compatible with newer versions of PHP.

The intention of this project is not to work as a modern alternative, but to provide support for legacy projects still
using this library. Please, consider migrating to newer alternatives if possible.

Updates
-------

* Compatible with PHP 7 and newer versions.
* Use of composer autoloader to replace includes.
